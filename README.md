# vim9jit

Ok, hear me out. vim9script... but in lua... so fast

## What??

So, here's my plan that I'm messing around with:

1. Write a `vim9script` parser using Rust (because I want to learn rust)
2. Write a generator from `vim9script` AST-like nodes -> Lua code.
3. Write wrappers to make it so that when a file sees `vim9script`, what it does instead is generate and expose the code in the correct way.
4. ???
5. Profit.

## Why?

Fun. Please do not expect this to be finished :)

## Notes:

It is unlikely that we will implement the _type checking_ features from Vim 9 (although that could be fun :laugh:).
However, to get your code type checked, you probably can just run it in Vim 9. This is more about a compatibility layer than it is about re-implementing everything.

For example, at the moment, I plan for `const` and `final` to simply be variables. I do not plan on creating the ability to error when editing these items.

## Status (Out Of Date)

TODO: Update this to Rust version once I get a few more things completed.

## Performance?

Well, it would be pretty funny if luajit outperformed native vim9script. We'll have to see.

*UPDATE*:

```vim
vim9script

var start = reltime()

def VimNew(): number
  var sum = 0
  for i in range(1, 2999999)
    sum = sum + i
  endfor

  return sum
enddef

echo VimNew()
echo reltimestr(reltime(start))

" Result:
" 4499998500000
" 0.082964
```

```lua
--[=[
Original vimscript
vim9script

var start = reltime()

def VimNew(): number
  var sum = 0
  for i in range(1, 2999999)
    sum = sum + i
  endfor

  return sum
enddef

echo VimNew()
echo reltimestr(reltime(start))

--]=]

local start = vim.fn['reltime']()
local function VimNew()
  local sum = 0
  for i = 1, 2999999, 1 do
    sum = sum + i
  end
  return sum
end
vim.cmd(string.format([[%s %s]], 'echo', VimNew()))
vim.cmd(string.format([[%s %s]], 'echo', vim.fn['reltimestr'](vim.fn['reltime'](start))))

--4499998500000
-- 0.002857
```


So... looks like we're pretty fast ;)

## Non-Goals

I don't think I want to write all the code that actually does the type checking and what not that is now going to be included in vim9script. I think I'll just pass that off to testing your code in vim9 (at least for now).

I will at least attempt to parse and keep that information for use later if desired.

## Examples

You can see the results in `./vim9_scripts/` where there are `*.vim` files and corresponding `*.lua` files that I've generated. I'll be adding more examples there later.
